## POC TinyTroupe - Technical Challenge

The documentation and codes repository of TinyTroupe are in the link
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe/tree/main">microsoft/TinyTroupe</a>.
In it you will find the necessary instructions to run this PoC scenario.
<br><br>
In this folder (examples/) you will find different use case notebooks that you can run, or adapt to create your own custom simulations.
<br>
The PoC notebook is products_recommendations.ipynb which creates a virtual e-commerce client and a group of specialized virtual agents who discuss what is the best product for the client for a chosen category. After the discussion, each agent selects the right product for the customer.
<br>
The methods for running that notebook are in the Python script utils/recommendations.py.
